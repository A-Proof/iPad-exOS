# iPad-exOS
The exOS operating system is a terminal addon to your iPad you can use to customize your iPad about and round and make web clips/web apps, you MUST have scriptable for this.
Apps you need on your iPad: 
Scriptable: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188
Shortcuts: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752
Now download the files, you'll need them! 
Open each scriptable document, then when you see the text interface, click on share > scriptable, then add it to your scripts! then open the shortcuts document and select the one you want to use, select the option, UI (shows a app-like terminal, but doesn't allow DNS Maker.) Or Console, which allow dns features to install .mobileconfig files, but harder to use. 

exOS UI Console Use tutorial:
open scriptable, go to the script, click on it, type in console "help" then enter your desired command!

exOS Console (no UI) tutorial: 
This one is a bit harder, open scriptable and click on the three dots by the script, then open the console (lift the gray line on screen bottom) then click on the run button (triange in bottom right) and click help and you'll be able to see the command text there.
